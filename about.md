## About Me


Hello, I'm kirito. My interests include Music, AI, and Robotics. I enjoy developing creative solutions to technical challenges.


### Work Experience


The majority of my experience has been in developing low-level software. I spent approximately 3 years working as a C++ developer writing software for Flight Management Systems at [Universal Avionics](https://uasc.com). Much of my work included writing backend interfaces to process aircraft sensor data.

I also worked at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/) as a Logic and Validation Intern. During my time there I worked on developing Verification Tests for the Power Management Unit on an SOC.
